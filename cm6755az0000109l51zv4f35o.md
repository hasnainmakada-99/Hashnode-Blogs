# Introduction

Hey everyone, It’s been a long time since I wrote my last blog in 2024, and I admit that my life has taken quite a drift in the past few years, The company with which I once knew has also been on pause for a long time and the job market has been down like anything, we don’t know when the situations are going to recover, but we should not lose hope, Speaking of which today I am going to discuss you about a very good thing which you can your GitHub profile, **A new README for your 2025**

**Sounds fun right!,** Let me discuss more below

# What are the things or resources which I used?

To create this template I just used 2 workflows and the rest of the images and icons were fetched from various resources. I also took some help from [Claude](https://claude.ai) to fine-tune my new readme, as I don’t know markdown in detail and am only familiar with the basics.

The **First Workflow** is the blogs workflow, with which if you have a hashnode account or any other blog site inside which you are publishing your blogs, then it will fetch your most recent 4 blogs (you can increase the number) and then print it on to your readme after the workflow is run perfectly.

The **Second Workflow** is going to be the metrics workflow, inside which you are going to show you gitub metrics to the end user/developer isndie whihc each and every details of your github contributions will be there, becase we all know that the github readme is the first thing which the employer or a developer sees

> Also note that for the metrics, the users need to generate a GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token) and you can refer this link [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-generate-personal-access-token-in-github/)
> 
> Note: Don’t use the fine-grain and just stick to the ‘tokens (classic)‘ while generating the token

# Template Guide

Below is the complete Guide of Template, make sure to do the necessary changes as per your preferences

# Make Your GitHub Profile Stand Out! 🚀

## Step 1: Create Your Profile Repository

1. Create a new repository with the same name as your GitHub username (example: if your username is `dev-jane-doe`, repository should be `dev-jane-doe`)
2. Clone it to your computer
3. Create these folders:
   ```
   .github/
     workflows/
   ```

## Step 2: Set Up the Workflows

### Blog Posts Workflow
Create `.github/workflows/blog-post-workflow.yml`:
```yaml
name: Latest blog post workflow
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-readme-with-blog:
    name: Update README with latest blog posts
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow@master
        with:
          feed_list: "https://your-blog-url.com/rss.xml"
          max_post_count: 4
```

### GitHub Metrics Workflow
Create `.github/workflows/metrics.yml`:
```yaml
name: Metrics
on:
  schedule: [{ cron: "0 0 * * *" }]
  workflow_dispatch:
  push: { branches: ["master", "main"] }
jobs:
  github-metrics:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: lowlighter/metrics@latest
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.METRICS_TOKEN }}
          
          # Options
          user: your-username
          template: classic
          base: header, activity, repositories
          config_timezone: Asia/Kolkata
          
          # Languages plugin
          plugin_languages: yes
          plugin_languages_limit: 8
          plugin_languages_colors: github
          plugin_languages_sections: most-used
          plugin_languages_threshold: 2%
          
          # Activity plugin
          plugin_activity: yes
          plugin_activity_limit: 5
          plugin_activity_days: 14
          plugin_activity_filter: all
          
          # Notable contributions
          plugin_notable: yes
          plugin_notable_repositories: yes
          
          # Lines of code changed
          plugin_lines: yes
          plugin_lines_history_limit: 1
          plugin_lines_repositories_limit: 4
          plugin_lines_sections: base
```

## Step 3: Create Your README

Create a new file called `README.md`:

```markdown
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://capsule-render.vercel.app/api?type=waving&color=gradient&height=200&section=header&text=Jane%20Doe&fontSize=80&animation=fadeIn" />

## Step 4: Set Up GitHub Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate new token with these permissions:
   - `repo`
   - `read:user`
   - `read:packages`
3. Copy the token

## Step 5: Add the Token to Your Repository

1. Go to your profile repository settings
2. Click on "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
3. Create new repository secret:
   - Name: `METRICS_TOKEN`
   - Value: (your token)

## Step 6: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "✨ Added awesome GitHub profile"
git push
```

## Customization Tips

Feel free to:
- Change the header/footer wave colors
- Modify sections to match your experience
- Add your own badges and stats
- Update the about section with your details
- Change the emoji style
- Add or remove sections based on your preferences

Remember to replace:
- `your-username` with your GitHub username
- `your-blog-url.com` with your actual blog URL
- The example email and social links with your own
- The example projects and current focus with your real ones
- The tech stack badges with your actual skills

That's it! Your profile should now look professional and dynamic! 🎉

## Need Help?

If anything isn't working:
1. Check if all files are in the correct locations
2. Verify your GitHub token has the right permissions
3. Make sure to replace all placeholder values
4. Wait a few minutes for the workflows to run

# The importance of documentation in DevOps

# Introduction

Hey everyone I am hasnain makada, currently building out [***Open Source with Hasnain***](https://hasnainmakada-99.github.io/Open-Source-With-Hasnain/#/) where beginners can find various resources regarding their particular tech stack and they can also contribute to open source at the same time. I also work as a Developer Advocate at [**Napptive**](https://napptive.com) where I explore the platform in Depth and also educate the community about DevOps and Flutter by writing blogs on [**Hashnode**](https://hasnainm.hashnode.dev) and [**Showwcase**](https://showwcase.com/hasnainmakada-99).

In this blog, I am going to explain the importance of documentation of DevOps and also going to provide you with a few examples of the best documentation out there of some DevOps tools.

# Let's get started

As we all know that documentation is an essential part of the DevOps process as it helps to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the systems, processes and procedures in place. Documentation can take many forms including system diagrams, runbook, procedures and manuals.

The main goal of documentation is to provide accurate and up-to-date information that is easily accessible to all stakeholders. This can include team members, customers, partners, and other interested parties. Good documentation helps to improve communication, reduce errors and increase efficiency by providing clear and concise information that is easy to understand and follow.

The main points of good DevOps documentation are as follows,

1. **System Diagrams:** The system diagrams include a pictorial representation of the system architecture and it shows how the tool works and how data is processed. It also includes different components and their interaction that help new team members quickly understand the system and how it works.
    
2. **Runbooks:** Runbooks provide detailed instructions for performing various tasks such as troubleshooting and maintenance while using the software. These runbooks ensure that all team members are aware of the correct procedures to follow in case any accident happens.
    
3. **Procedure Manuals:** Procedure manuals provide step-by-step instructions for various processes such as provisioning new servers, deploying code changes and performing backups. This helps to ensure that all members are aware of the procedures and can perform them consistently.
    
4. **Knowledge base:** A knowledge base is a centralized location where all documentation can be stored and accessed. This can be a great tool for new team members to quickly find the information they need.
    

Overall, documentation helps to improve communication and collaboration between team members, reduce errors and improve efficiency. It also help to prevent knowledge silos and ensure that everyone has access to the information they need to do their jobs effectively.

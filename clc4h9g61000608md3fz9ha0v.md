# Open Source with Hasnain

# **What OSWH is all about?**

**Hey everyone, I am Hasnain Makada and currently working as a Developer Advocate at Napptive where I explore the platform in Depth and educate the community about DevOps and Flutter. I also maintain an Open Source non-code project named** [***“Open Source with Hasnain”***](https://github.com/hasnainmakada-99/Open-Source-With-Hasnain) **where various developers, regardless of their tech experience, can find resources that the community provides to you.**

In OSWH, whether you are a beginner or an experienced techie, you can contribute your knowledge to it as it is completely open-sourced and is meant to be open-source forever. Always remember **“*Collaboration first, Code Second - Eddie Jaoude*”**.

# **How did I get the idea to start a no-code project?**

We all know that every experienced was once a beginner who started from scratch. When I started my journey in majoring my CS, I got to know about Open Source by watching video tutorials on [**Youtube**](https://youtube.com/)**.** At first, when I opened GitHub and explored a few repositories, I was so demotivated and I thought that I cannot do it because contributing to open source required some basic common sense that I was not having in me.

Then one day I was exploring youtube and I got to know about this awesome video by [Eddie Jaoude](https://youtu.be/yzeVMecydCE), where he explains that open source is not all about code, It is all about collaboration with the community.

And from that day, I started working on improving my documentation skills and contributed my no-code skills to open source and it really changed the way I used to maintain my projects.

Open source with Hasnain was started with an Initiative to encourage more and more developers to contribute to open source by sharing the resources from which they are currently and they think it should be shared with all.

Users can find various resources regarding DevOps, Open Source, Android, Web, and so on… This is just the beginning, we will add more resources as we grow and encourage others also to add resources.

# **What are our future plans?**

Currently, our project is still in its initial development phase and it will forever be under development as it is maintained by open-source contributors.

In the upcoming months/years, we will soon introduce video tutorials as well so, currently, we are just providing the link to the resources, but soon we’ll make sure that users can directly start watching the resources from our site and get an overall idea of how good the resource is and if they want to access the resource, they can directly access by clicking the link provided.

We encourage more and more developers to contribute to our community and help other developers also.

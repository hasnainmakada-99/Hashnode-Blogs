## My post hackathon thoughts - Data day grind 3

## Introduction

Hey everyone I am Hasnain Makada and today I am writing this blog to share my thoughts about the MLH hackathon in which I participated and what are some of the new things which I learned and should you attend it ?

## Hackathon in which I participated

I recently participated in the data day grind 3 hackathon which was a virtual hackathon hosted by MLH every weekends from Friday to Sunday evenings. Every week MLH hosts a new hackathon in which their main motive is to have fun as a developer. Whether or not you build any projects, Have fun. They also include some prizes for the ones who are building.

If you're building projects on the topics which they give you, There are also chances that you'll win the prizes. But you can build anything that you want, Nothing is mandatory to build on the theme.

## Project which I made

This was my first virtual hackathon in which I participated, Though I have participated in 1 or 2 offline hackathons which were hosted by my college, It was really fun.

In the first day of the hackathon itself I was able to find a teammate as I was also attending solo in the hackathon & we build a tic - tac - toe game in flutter.

I've previously also built this game already, But I was always so lazy to improve it. This time we built a fully new working game from scratch, And this time as I was working mainly on the coding side there were some increased complexities for me while building the game. I learned so many new widgets to make the game responsive for every screen and also learned to test each and every widget during this hackathon

My teammate Ayush (Glad to have him on my team) worked a lot on the documentation side. His documenting skills are just great. He also solved some of the crashes which my game was making while running on the emulator.

## Submission

At the end of day 2 the project should be completed, Make sure to make a project which is easy and quick to finish. You also have to upload a demo video to Devpost and as soon as the hackathon due date will get finish they will declare the results in 1 - 2 hours.

Attending Hackathons is the best way to learn something. If they are giving you time limits to build a project, You will have to complete your project in it and that's how you'll learn time management.

## Conclusion

That's all I want to say about my recent Hackathon, I've decided to attend at least one hackathon every month if you also want to attend hackathons check out their site [MLH](https://www.mlh.io)

Happy Building ðŸ˜Š
